### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title: An Examination of the 2016 Presidential Election
+ This project is conducted by Yushi Pan

+ Project summary: This project is an analysis of people's voting preferences towards the 2016 presidential election. By preprocessing the raw data and visualizing the cleaned data, the following three main questions are answered in this project:

++ Does the survey result about who they voted agree on the actual election result? 
++ Are there any demographic differences between the coalitions that support the two major party nominees?
++ Is this true that people don't care about politics tend not to vote?
