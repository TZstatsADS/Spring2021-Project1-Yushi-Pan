# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the Presidential Elections in the US

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

In this project, the data we use: anes_timeseries_cdf.sav: including answers, from respondents from different years, on
selected questions related to election that have been asked in three or more ANESâ€™ Time Series studies.
